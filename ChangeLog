0.1.2
{
	-Allow anonymous functions to be used in frame and Snip end scripts
	-Allow values to be passed into frame and Snip end scripts
}

Beta - 0.1.3
{
	---
	Steps to update from 0.1.2:
	-Remove snip_animation_end_event() from the Animation End event in all objects
	-Replace the boolean "should repeat" in snip_create_ext() value with a value from the new ae_snip_end enum
	---

	-You no longer need to add snip_animation_end_event() to your objects
	-Allow Snips to be marked to play backwards with snip_set_backward/snip_set_forward
			-Snips that will be played backwards will still work with loops
			-Don't use a negative value for Snip speeds, use a positive value
	-Changed the way Snips behave when finished playing. Instead of just a boolean
		indicating whether or not to repeat, now it's an enum with 5 different options:
			-ae_snip_end.end_stop
			-ae_snip_end.end_repeat
			-ae_snip_end.end_pingpong
			-ae_snip_end.end_pingpong_first
			-ae_snip_end.end_pingpong_last			
	-Allow Snips to pingpong back and forth when they finish playing
		-Three types of pinpong are available to determine when the Snip is "completed"
			-pingpong: The Snip is completed when it gets to the first or last frame
			-pingpong_first: The Snip is completed when it gets back to the first frame
			-pingpong_last: The Snip us completed the last frame
		-When a Snip completes it will execute the completion script, and then try to play the next Snip
			if there is not another Snip to play then look at the Snip end type to determine what to do (stop/repeat/pingpong)
}
